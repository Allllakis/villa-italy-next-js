Nice and cozy beach, white towels. outside of the hotel is problematic. You can use the free boat ride for 2 hours. I really liked it! I advise!",

The breakfast was the best we had during our honeymoon trip around Italy. And the view is a spectacular accompaniment. We cannot wait to return at some point in the future.',
